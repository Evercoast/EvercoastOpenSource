# Attribution

Should you wish to list Evercoast in the end credits of your film/game/experience, we'd really appreciate that! The proper location would be in the "logos" section at the very end, just after any Guild Logos (SAG, DGA, PGA, etc.), alongside any other Equipment / Technology Providers (Unity, Unreal, Adobe, RED, Arri, etc.).
